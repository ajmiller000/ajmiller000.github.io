<b>Project Summary.</b>
<br>
Regional sea level trends (Rt) are affected by local and remote wind forcing, which can cause sustained changes in ocean circulation and sea level heights (SLH). Rt variations occur about the globally averaged sea level trend (Gt), which has been estimated to increase from about 1.7 mm/yr over the 20th century to about 3 mm/yr since 1993. The main causes for positive Gt are added water from the melting of ice sheets and glaciers and thermal expansion of the oceans, both driven by global warming. Along the U.S. Pacific coast, tide gauges suggest that Rt ~ Gt over the 20th century (within estimated uncertainties and correcting for land motion), but tide gauges and satellite altimetry both indicate that Rt is less than Gt since the late 1980s-early 1990s.  Not only has Rt along the eastern boundary of the North Pacific been considerably less than the recent altimetry-estimated Gt (3 mm/yr), but it is also less than the 20th century tide gauge estimate of Gt (1.7 mm/yr).

The effects of changes in wind stress patterns associated with the strengthening of the Hadley circulation during recent decades on sea levels across the Pacific basin and particularly along the California coast will be investigated with ocean model simulations. We will compare model runs forced with observed wind stresses from 1950-2008 to tandem runs forced with wind stresses that remove and reverse the impact of the Hadley cell changes. These patterns of forcing will be identified by compositing the time periods when the Hadley cell was "strengthened" and "normal" and then differencing the result. This anomaly will then be removed from the basic wind forcing to obtain the modeled Pacific circulation and sea level pattern that would have resulted from "normal" Hadley cell conditions during the 1980's, 1990's and 2000's. The simulation will tell us what California coastal sea level would have looked like today if the Hadley cell (and trade winds) had not intensified during the last 30 years. It will also tell us what California sea level would do if the Hadley cell changes reverse and instead weaken in the future instead. The patterns that arise will be related to, and be used to explain dynamically, the observed altimetry record of sea level in the 1990's and 2000's that shows strong sea level rise in the western North Pacific and flat sea level changes along the CA coast.
