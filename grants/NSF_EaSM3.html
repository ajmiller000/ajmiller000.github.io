<b>Project Summary.</b>
<br>
Climate in the Pacific sector is well known to vary on decadal timescales, but the mechanisms
that control these long-term climate variations are still unclear. If the mechanisms can be
better understood, then the uncertainties associated with making climate predictions on these
timescales can be assessed more accurately. Decadal variability of Pacific climate is of particular
interest in the U.S. due to its downstream influence over the western U.S. and its direct
influence on climate in Alaska. This leads to the primary focus of our proposal:
<br>
Overarching Question: What are the predictability limits, mechanisms, and regional impacts
for decadal modes of the Pacific climate system?
<br>
There is clearly a large gap in our understanding of what controls Pacific decadal climate
variability, what limits the predictability of the flows, and what practical skill might be
useful in regional impacts on land and in the ocean. Given the availability of a major new
climate model, the Community Earth System Model (CESM), a coordinated research effort is needed
to better understand basic physical dynamics of Pacific decadal variability and assess the
skill of Pacific decadal predictability, along with its uncertainties and practical value.
<br>
We propose a wide-ranging, coordinated research effort to address key issues of Pacific decadal
climate predictability, driving mechanisms, and regional impacts. The proposed work brings
together scientists skilled with developing decadal climate diagnostics, making both statistical
and dynamical predictions, and executing regional coupled climate downscaling and regional
high-resolution ocean modeling to work together to address a suite of important issues in
a multi-faceted research program involving senior scientists, early career scientists, post-docs,
and graduate students. The research focuses on CESM, with its vast repository of archived
runs supplemented with targeted predictability experiments. The analysis focuses on using
sophisticated statistical models (Linear Inverse Models) to identify statistical relations
among variables, diagnose physical processes, and isolate potentially predictable components
of the flows. It also involves using regional coupled atmosphere-ocean, along with uncoupled
ocean and atmosphere models, to enhance the understanding of regional response and its potential
for practical use in forecasting.
<br>
The results will be important in assessing how long-term changes in the environment drive
changes in economically important variables such as rainfall, soil moisture, snowfall, temperatures,
as well as oceanic temperatures, currents and sea levels, which impacts fisheries, agriculture,
and coastal infrastructure along the U.S. West Coast and Asian Marginal Seas. We expect that
our techniques will be transferable to other global sectors that also exhibit decadal variability.
<br>
The team will mentor graduate students and post-docs, whose educational experiences will
include cross-disciplinary exposure to ocean science, atmospheric science, and societal impacts
that will be unique in this context. We also will continue our various efforts of community
outreach by giving lectures and educational presentations in public forums, mentoring K-12
students, educating grass-roots climate action organizations, informing the media, and posting
our research results on web pages.
