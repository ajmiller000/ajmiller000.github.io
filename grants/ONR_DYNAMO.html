<b>Project Summary.</b>
<br>
We propose to continue our efforts as part of the DRI MJO team to study the predictability and coupled dynamics of MJO using global and regional coupled ocean-atmosphere models. Our effort focuses on two models: SCOAR2, which is a high-resolution regional coupled ocean-atmosphere model that couples the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS); and CCSM4, which is a NCAR's global moderate resolution model. Both models support significant eastward propagating convectively coupled disturbances in the MJO wavenumber-frequency band. We propose to use SCOAR2 and CCSM in conjunction with DYNAMO observations to investigate (a) genesis and evolution mechanisms of MJO.s in the tropical strip, (b) dynamical and thermodynamical impacts and consequences of ocean-atmosphere coupling, (c) sensitivity to initial conditions in predictability experiments, and (d) sensitivity to boundary conditions and remote processes in the atmospheric and oceanic models. 
<br>
We plan to actively interact with both DRI modelers and observers to identify key aspects of the types of MJO behavior captured during the three DYNAMO events and to breakdown the dynamical and thermodynamical balances in the context of exploring potential predictability both regionally and globally. 
<br>
Our team features extensive multi-disciplinary and collaborative experience with MJO dynamics, coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics and modeling, and theoretical predictability. This research will help to solidify the practical framework for real-time operational forecasting of MJO's.
