<b>Project Summary.</b>
<br>
Aerosol effects on clouds operate at spatial scales of short-lived cloud updrafts (typically 100 m-
100 km), yet exert a global effect on climate over multiple decades. The multiscale nature of
these indirect effects on the planetary energy balance presents particular challenges to climate
modeling, which has led to large uncertainties in estimates of indirect effects. The most difficult
types of aerosol indirect effects to quantify are those for which the aerosol sources are
controlled by complex interactions of ecosystems with climate, such as the aerosol emissions
from ocean phytoplankton and from wildfires in forests. The decadal feedbacks of climate onto
biological productivity contribute to this uncertainty because of the difficulties in making accurate
multidecadal predictions and in collecting detailed observations on comparable time scales.
<br>
This proposed project addresses these challenges through a combination of
advanced parameterizations, explicit modeling, and observations with a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary
team of experts. Advanced parameterizations of aerosol effects on stratocumulus,
shallow cumulus and deep cumulus clouds that have been or are being developed under
separate funding will be brought together into a common framework for multidecadal simulations
with and without coupling with the ocean. These simulations will be compared with available
observations and with simulations for selected periods by a multiscale modeling framework (a
cloud-resolving model operating as a superparameterization within each grid cell of a global
model) that has recently been extended to treat cloud-aerosol interactions. Offline single column
simulations with the parameterized and superparameterized cloud-aerosol interactions will be
compared with observations for selected field experiments characterizing warm clouds, mixedphase
clouds, and cirrus. The coupled and uncoupled simulations with and without interactive
aerosols will be examined to determine the influence of aerosol indirect effects on decadal
climate variability. This evaluation will be accomplished by relating climate-scale changes in
oceanic and atmospheric conditions over the Pacific, including tropical teleconnections and
midlatitude downstream effects, to the sensitivities of regional ocean-atmosphere interactions to
aerosols along the west coast of North America and consequent atmospheric flows and
hydrological conditions over the entire U.S. The evaluation will consider the decadal and
interannual variability of clouds, temperature, precipitation, and hydrologic conditions, and the
processes affected by aerosols.
