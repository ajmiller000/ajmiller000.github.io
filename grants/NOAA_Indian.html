<b>Project Summary.</b>
<br>

The basic understanding of the influence of El Nino suggests a
stronger subsidence over West Pacific and southeast Asia due to a
modified Walker circulation over the Pacific and hence it results in
a deficient monsoon. The 1987 El Nino and to a large extent, the 1982
El Nino resulted in a deficient Asian summer monsoon. However, in
1997, the very strong El Nino resulted in surplus rainfall over the
Asian continent and a concomitant stronger monsoon circulation. The
2002 El Nino resulted in a drought over India and Asia. We plan to
study how the Maddden-Julian Oscillations, preceding the El Nino
events, modify the influence of the anomalous Walker circulation and
anomalous local Hadley Circulation over the Indian Ocean. We will
also try and understand the influence of El Ninos on the Asian summer
monsoon better.

The project involves analyzing the output of a coupled ocean-atmosphere
model of the Indian Ocean sector, which was run by Dr. Hyodae Seo (Hawaii).
Graduate student Subramanian will execute statistical analysis of
the output to attempt to identify the coupled and uncoupled
variations that lead to these effects on the monsoon.  Supplemental
runs of the uncoupled atmosphere and uncoupled ocean,
forced by the coupled model SST and surface flux fields, respectively,
will aid in this analysis.  Miller (SIO), Murtugudde (UMd),
Jochum (NCAR) and Seo (Hawaii) will jointly lead the effort
which will become a part of Subramanian's Ph.D. thesis.
