<b>Project Summary.</b>
<br>
This contract will expand the understanding of the factors controlling the tsunami wave amplitudes along the continental shelf near and in Crescent City Harbor that include the (i) source location of the tsunami, which sets the direction of the primary waves, (ii) offshore topographic structures (such as the Mendocino Fracture Zone, which can channel wave energy towards Crescent City Harbor, (iii) reflected wave energy off major ocean boundary features or island chains (such as Hawaii), (iv) source temporal characteristics, which can yield multiple arrivals of waves at Crescent City Harbor, as well as (v) contributions from regional-to-local continental-shelf modes and (vi) harbor resonance characteristics.
