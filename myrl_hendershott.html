<p><small><font face="Arial">Lander, Wyoming, is certainly a lovely
community, but can scarcely claim any ocean front property. It can
claim one of the country's outstanding oceanographers. Myrl Hendershott
was raised in Lander and came to the University in 1954 at the age of
fourteen to study physics. According to his teacher, professor emeritus
Burton Muller, "During his years at UW, he managed his precocious
talents incredibly well, quietly earning As in tough courses, making
friends with his college peers, and playing the organ at St. Matthew's
Cathedral." </font></small></p>
<font face="Arial"><small>Hendershott was awarded a Woodrow Wilson
Fellowship to Harvard, where he earned Master and Doctorate degrees in
physics. In 1965, he accepted a position at the University of
California/San Diego's Scripps Institute of Oceanography, one of the
world's premier research institutions. He was an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow
from 1967-69. In recognition of his distinguished work in physical
sciences associated with the sea, he was awarded the 1972 W.B. Wood
Medal and Prize by the Institute of Physics. Now a full professor at
Scripps, he serves on significant research panels in the world. For
example, he worked with a consulting group to provide advice on how to
save the city of Venice from the sea. He currently serves on the
Physical Oceanography Panel of the National Research Council's
Committee to Review the Outer Continental Shelf Environmental Studies
Program. Results of his studies in oceanography have appeared in
numbers of scientific journal articles and book chapters. </small>
<small>Burton Muller recalls an incident from Hendershott's days at UW:
"He and the other physics majors persuaded me to participate in a noon
bicycle race around Prexy's Pasture. After I scolded them for not
showing up to cheer me on, they appeased me with a record of Vivaldi's
Four Seasons, Hendershott's choice, no doubt." </small></font></td>
