<br>

For though the beauty of the Quendi  <br>
in the days of their youth <br>
was beyond all other beauty  <br>
that Iluvatar has caused to be, <br>
it has not perished,  <br>
but lives in the West, <br>
and sorrow and wisdom  <br>
have enriched it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
- J.R.R. Tolkien, from The Silmarillion, "Of the Coming of the Elves" <br>

More than 30 years ago, 18-yr-old Jenny Rola. and 20-yr-old Artie Miller <br>
left behind their lives in Missouri and Ohio <br>
to seek adventure and beauty in the pine forests and mountain ranges <br>
of Yellowstone National Park during the summer of 1978.  <br>
<br>

By chance, they found each other <br>
in the glorious sunshine and glittering stars of the wilderness <br>
and in their attending a performance of "South Pacific" in the Teton Theatre in Jackson Hole.  <br>
And a romance blossomed at the Old Faithful Lodge.  <br>

<br>

Some enchanted evening <br>
You may see a stranger, <br>
you may see a stranger <br>
Across a crowded room <br>
And somehow you know, <br>
You know even then <br>
That somewhere you'll see her <br>
Again and again. <br>
<br>

Some enchanted evening <br>
Someone may be laughin', <br>
You may hear her laughin' <br>
Across a crowded room <br>
And night after night, <br>
As strange as it seems <br>
The sound of her laughter <br>
Will sing in your dreams. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- From "South Pacific" by Rodgers and Hammerstein <br>

<br>

Although pride and fear caused them to hide their true feelings, <br>
and then distance and time separated them, <br>
while they built their lives and raised their children, <br>
a powerful and long-dormant seed was planted in Yellowstone <br>
that miraculously sprouted decades later. <br>

<br>
<strong>
Matteo: 
</strong>
<br>

Still round the corner there may wait <br>
A new road or a secret gait <br>
And though we pass them by today <br>
Tomorrow we may come this way <br>
And take the hidden paths that run <br>
Towards the moon or to the sun <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Bilbo Baggins, from the Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien <br>

<strong>
Sasha:
</strong>
<br>

Who can explain it? <br>
Who can tell you why? <br>
Fools give you reasons, <br>
Wise men never try. <br>
<br>

Some enchanted evening <br>
When you find your true love, <br>
When you feel her call you <br>
Across a crowded room, <br>
Then fly to her side, <br>
And make her your own <br>
Or all through your life you <br>
May dream all alone. <br>
<br>

Once you have found her, <br>
Never let her go. <br>
Once you have found her, <br>
Never let her go! <br>

Now, with their love in full radiant bloom, <br>
we stand here together as friends and family <br>
with the two lovers who are ready to pledge their troth <br>
and share the rest of their lives as husband and wife.<br>

<br>
<strong>
Mary:
</strong>
<br>

Try, try to forget, <br>
What's in the past, <br>
Tomorrow is here. <br>
Love, warm sky above, <br>
lighting your way <br>
there's nothing to fear. <br>
Birds singing a song, <br>
Old paint is peeling, <br>
This is that fresh <br>
That fresh feeling. <br>
Words can't be that strong, <br>
my heart is reeling, <br>
This is that fresh, <br>
That fresh feeling. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

From the Big River and from the Flats of the Cuyahoga <br>
to the Golden Shores of the California Coast, <br>
Jenny and Art have merged their lives and families. <br>
Their lifetimes of experiences have forged their characters and spirits, <br>
and they find themselves compatible, supportive, positive, passionate, <br>
and, above all, loving beings.<br>

<br>
<strong>
Sasha:

<br>


Borne <br>
On the first warm winds of <br>
Feelings newly found <br>
Fly <br>
But remember <br>
Don't look down <br>
Take as much as you think you ought to <br>
Give just as much as you can <br>
Don`t forget what your failures have taught you <br>
Or else you'll learn them all over again <br>
Or else you'll have to learn them <br>
All over again <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ian:
</strong>
<br>

Let's be undecided,  <br>
let's take our time <br>
And sooner or later,  <br>
we will know our mind <br>
We'll be on the outside,  <br>
we won't care <br>
Cause we're together,  <br>
that's somewhere. <br>
<br>

I woke up early,  <br>
couldn't go back to sleep <br>
Cause I had been thinking  <br>
of where it all would lead <br>
So I made you wake up,  <br>
I said, "Let's take a walk, <br>
I wanna hold your hand,  <br>
we don't have to talk" <br>
<br>

And there's a big day coming,  <br>
about a mile away <br>
There's a big day coming,  <br>
I can hardly wait. <br>

<br>

Late in his career,  <br>
when he was playing in pain every day, <br>
Joe DiMaggio was asked by a reporter <br>
why he hustled so hard  <br>
on a play  <br>
that meant so little  <br>
in a game <br>
that had no bearing  <br>
on the Yankees' pennant chances  <br>
that year. <br>
<br>

DiMaggio said:  <br>
"Because there might be some kid out there <br>
who's never seen me play before.  <br>
I owe him my best" <br>
<br>

This creed, going "all out" every day for one another, is one that we should all live by. <br>

<br>
<strong>
Peter:
</strong>
<br>

Let your beauty be not  <br>
just the outward adorning of braiding the hair,  <br>
and of wearing jewels of gold,  <br>
or of putting on fine clothing; <br>
But in the hidden person of the heart,  <br>
in the incorruptible adornment  <br>
of a gentle and quiet spirit,  <br>
which is in the sight of God  <br>
very precious. <br>
Be like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, courteous, <br>
not rendering evil for evil, or insult for insult; <br>
We who would love life, and see good days,  <br>
let us keep our tongues from evil,  <br>
and our lips from speaking deceit. <br>
Let us turn away from evil,  <br>
and do good.  <br>
Let us seek peace,  <br>
and pursue it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- 1 Peter 3:3-11 <br>
<br>
<strong> 
Mary: 
</strong> 
 <br>
Put on then....compassion, kindness,  <br>
lowliness, meekness, and patience,  <br>
forbearing one another and,  <br>
if one has a complaint against another,  <br>
forgiving each other. <br>
And above all these put on love,  <br>
which binds everything together  <br>
in perfect harmony.  <br>
And let the peace of Christ  <br>
rule in your hearts.... <br>
And be thankful. <br>
 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>

Jenny and Art, you may now give your vows to each other. <br>

<br>
<strong>
Jenny:
</strong>
<br>
As if time stood still, <br>
you accepted me back into your life <br>
with open arms and a warm open heart.  <br>
This second chance has allowed me to appreciate and recognize <br>
the beautiful person you are and how lucky I am. <br>
<br>

I take you Arthur Joseph Miller to be my husband <br>
to love, honor, cherish and respect all the days of my life.  <br>
I look forward to every day with you and want to grow old together in love.   <br>
"The more I give, the more I have, for both are infinite." <br>

<br>
<strong>
Art:
</strong>
<br>
From that spellbound jeep ride through Yellowstone and the Tetons, <br>
to the electric enchantment of at last looking into your beautiful eyes once again. <br>
From the fear of humiliation and rejection  <br>
to the courage of revelation and commitment. <br>
From just my imagination running away with me, <br>
to trading all my tomorrows for a single yesterday that can now last forever. <br>
<br>

Jenny Rola', I've waited 30 years to say this. <br>
I take you as my wife, <br>
with all the love and understanding of my heart and spirit, <br>
here now, for you, spoken freely and passionately <br>
in front of our families and friends. <br>

<br>
<strong>
Drew:  
</strong>
<br>

Jenny and Art, you may now give each other the rings <br>
that represent symbols of your enduring love and lasting affection. <br>

<br>
<strong>
Mary: 
</strong>
<br>

You and I,  <br>
TOGETHER,  <br>
as long as we are,  <br>
that's all that matters.  <br>
TOMORROW doesn't exist.  <br>
There can only be NOW.  <br>
You cannot ask for more.  <br>
There is NO MORE to ask. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

By the powers vested in my by the State of California and the Universal Life Church, <br>

You may now kiss.
