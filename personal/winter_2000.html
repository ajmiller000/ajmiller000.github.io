We stayed a coupled of days at a sloth (and other animal) sanctuary on the
Carribbean Coast.
It was very pleasant and relaxing to sit on the second story balcony
(where breakfast was served) and watch the incredibly diverse numbers of
birds along the river and in the jungle.

They had one of their rescued sloths, named Buttercup,
living on the bird-viewing patio/balcony.

Matteo loved the sloth and looked forward every day to holding it.
He acted out sloth movements incessantly for the rest of the trip, 
and cried when we left her behind.

We toured the estuary in front of the lodge in a canoe with a nice guide.
He pointed out lots of interesting birds, sloths and caimans.

The guide cut a great bouquet of fresh flowers that would have cost
$150 in the U.S.  He put them in a vase made of bamboo;  we accidently left
it in the next place we stayed.
