<!--- CUTLINE: When his advisers closed the door, doctoral student   Justin Kulongoski felt the pressure of defending his dissertation at Scripps   Institution of Oceanography.
For his doctoral thesis, Justin Kulongoski measured trace   gases in ancient Botswanan aquifers to piece together a climatology record. &#34;I   just think it's a neat problem,&#34; he notes.  K.C. Alfred / Union Tribune photos
   Emanuele Di Lorenzo successfully defended his thesis at   Scripps last month, ending life as a doctoral student. He embarks on a teaching   job at Georgia Tech next fall.

"I f anyone wants to take a vendetta against Manu, now's the time."<P>
     Emanuele Di Lorenzo - Manu - looks over and smiles shyly at his academic    adviser and mentor, Art Miller, who has just declared open season on him before   a room packed with about 60 fellow students, oceanographers, world class   authorities and family members. <P>
  The outgoing native of Rome has spent an hour accounting for his last six years   as a graduate student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography with a PowerPoint   presentation of his doctoral dissertation. Di Lorenzo's formal thesis defense,   the final exam that every  Ph.D. candidate must complete before the mantle of   research scientist is bestowed, has an X-factor built in: It is open to the   public, so literally anyone could theoretically challenge his findings.<P>
  Di Lorenzo's thesis uses ocean modeling to demonstrate that a one-degree   average warming trend and a decline in zooplankton in the California Current   between 1950 and 1998 are not attributable to global warming. Before the first   question, Di Lorenzo glances at his mother, Annamaria Poeta, who journeyed all   the way from Rome.<P>
     The former model (she resembles Sophia Loren) sits a few rows from the   front, exuding joy and loving support, but Manu could be excused for feeling   glad she doesn't speak English.<P>
     A candidate's mother entered the realm of academic nightmare two years ago   at Scripps when she came to hear her son's defense of studies he had conducted   on organic molecules in meteorites for his Ph.D. When the candidate's adviser   opened the floor to questions, generally a tense time for the students, his   mother tried to help by lobbing what she thought was a puffball about   meteorites becoming contaminated when they enter Earth's atmosphere. <P>
     "He bluffed his way through, but it was a good question and she kind of   stumped him," explains a professor who was there. "And the guy goes, 'Awwh,   mom!', which you could hear throughout the room."<P>
     Di Lorenzo's mother smiles beatifically as her son fields audience questions   having to do with spatial variations of zooplankton in the California Current   (He hadn't looked at that), and whether the ocean model could track a recent   cooling trend off California (He's working on it). Then, as his many friends,   fellow students and working oceanographers file out of Nierenberg Hall, Manu   sits down with his five academic advisers for the final "exam," in which the   professors will grill him in private on any weaknesses in his paper. <P>
     As the door closes Art Miller can be heard saying, "OK, let's really nail   him."<P>
    
<FONT CLASS="dailysubsub">  Only the big points</FONT><BR>
    In theory that door could open and Di Lorenzo could come out disgraced,   the brain trust having decided his thesis was a wash. But that's more a   possibility in England, where traditionally one of the candidate's advisers is   a world authority from outside the university, so the candidate's work may be   judged more harshly.<P>
     "We wouldn't let them get to this point if there were serious problems with   their thesis," says Dave Hilton, a geophysicist who mentored two of the   candidates who defended in May. "At this stage, the students are virtually our   colleagues, and you've been working with them for years. By the time they   defend, you hope they've reached the point where they can get a job doing   science, or anything they want. Even be a journalist."<P>
     Several of the 25 doctoral students who defended this year, the 100th   anniversary of the establishment of the Scripps campus, said they felt a   complicated form of pressure, owing to the necessity to finish the thesis while   simultaneously trying to line up a post doc position, a real job or finally   allow themselves some foolish romance.<P>
     "It's difficult to put everything you've done in the last five years into a   45-minute talk," says Alison Shaw, a Vancouver native who delved into the   belching mouths of volcanoes to sample 750-degree gases for her studies of how   Earth's magma recycles certain chemical elements. "You don't want to overwhelm   them, but you also want to show the breadth of your work. We'll see how I do."<P>
     A fellow student who defended in May, Justin Kulongoski, declares, "It's   always a bit intimidating getting up in front of the world experts in your   field. But all you can really do is hit the highlights of what you've done."<P>
     The 32-year-old Oregon farm boy's thesis is about using traces of Noble   gases in ancient aquifers to piece together a climatology record in Botswana   and central Australia.<P>
     "The defense is the fruition of all the work you've been doing. It's a bit   nostalgic, remembering your early days at Scripps, and reliving a very intense   period in which you're working six, seven days a week for 12 or 14 hours a day.   Graduating from Scripps is difficult mentally, physically and emotionally,   which is why not many of us get married while we're here. But you can only   present a small aspect of it in the defense. That's the challenge."<P>
     Kulongoski says he wasn't nervous before or during his presentation, but   when the crowd left and his advisers closed the door for his final examination,   he felt a little fluttery. "There's always the uncertainty of what they're   going to pose to you," he reports. "But a lot of it was discussing parts of the   science that nobody knows. There are bigger questions being asked, and my work   was just a piece of the puzzle."<P>
     It helped that parts of his thesis, like those of most other Scripps   candidates, had already been published in scientific journals.<P>
     
<FONT CLASS="dailysubsub">  No matter the money </FONT><BR>
     Kulongoski's interest in measuring the properties of groundwater so   that the resource can be better managed fits the pattern in which most doctoral   projects strive to be of beneficial use to humanity. "If it doesn't connect up   to the real world, it's just not as interesting," explains Catherine Johnson,   34, who recently defended her thesis examining the dormancy period of copepods,   tiny planktonic crustaceans, which are important to both fishermen and   submarine sonar men. "But really I just think it's a neat problem - how   organisms change environment and behavior from part of the year to another, and   how they interact with climate variability."<P>
     Much of her work was funded by the Office of Naval Research, and she also   received grants from the San Diego Chapter of the ARCS Foundation, Achievement   Rewards for College Scientists.<P>
     Like Kulongoski, whose technical skills allowed him to help build two gas   spectrometers in his adviser's lab, and whose ability to speak Indonesian   helped him organize expeditions to that part of the world, Johnson had a   special talent that was invaluable. The granddaughter of a tool and die maker,   she used to be a bicycle mechanic, and being good with her hands was crucial on   many occasions during her six long cruises and 10 one-day cruises on Scripps   research vessels.<P>
     Johnson became expert at deploying and recovering a complex oceanographic   instrument called Moc Ness - the Multiple Opening and Closing Net and   Environmental Sensing System, which has 10 separate nets that open and close at   different depths. Twice she had to completely disassemble and reassemble the   monster at sea. <P>
     "She's a true-blue oceanographer," says Dave Checkley, her mentor and chief   academic adviser, as he approaches a table holding a copepod-shaped cake (with   red licorice antennae) at a small seaside party after her thesis defense. A   thank-you card signed by fellow students, most of them a year or two behind   her, is filled with effusive notes of gratitude for her help with their   projects.<P>
     Manu Di Lorenzo was also popular with fellow students and professors because   his special skill - facility with computers - led him to be of great assistance   to them. At the end of his thesis defense, when he was offering thanks while   displaying funny pictures of friends and colleagues who contributed to his   work, he became touchingly nostalgic when he showed a picture of fellow-Scripps   grad Kim Cobb, his fiancee, both of whom have landed teaching jobs starting   next fall at Georgia Tech.<P>
     "It's a sign of incredible civilization for an institution like Scripps to   actually pay for me to come here from Italy to get a degree," Di Lorenzo says.<P>
     Indeed, virtually nobody pays for a Ph.D. out of his own pocket; if you get   accepted at Scripps (this year 400 applied, 70 got in), all of the $16,000   annual cost in tuition and fees, plus another $17,000 a year in living   expenses, is covered by research grants, fellowships and other outside funding   sources. Basically, the candidate is not allowed to pay out of his or her own   pocket, a mechanism that ensures a fat checkbook is not a factor in selecting   students.<P>
     
<FONT CLASS="dailysubsub">  Clink to success </FONT><BR>
     As Di Lorenzo and his advisers huddle behind closed doors, his mother   and his future in-laws, Sara Cobb and Carlos Sluzki, fidget around some picnic   benches on a bright quadrangle overlooking the Scripps Pier. Cobb is director   of the Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason   University, near Washington, D.C., and Sluzki is a psychiatrist.<P>
     "Academic communities are always polarized," says Cobb, "so the questioning   of Manu's thesis signaled affinity and dissonance with the thing that's edgy   about his work - building models that simulate data.
