<b>Abstract.</b>
Some recent advances in large-scale modeling
of the California Current and its interaction with basin-scale 
circulation and forcing are summarized.
The discussion concentrates
on a decadal-scale change and 
interannual-scale variations 
identified in the thermocline off the California Coast.
The western-intensified decadal-scale change is part of
a basin-wide change in the North Pacific thermocline
from the early 1970s to the early 1980s 
which has been observed and modeled.
The decadal change is driven by a basin-scale change in wind-stress
curl (Ekman pumping) and 
is associated with a deepening of the 
thermocline off California but no significant change in the 
strength of the California Current.
Interannual variations of the thermocline off the California
Coast which tend to be associated with ENSO 
have also been observed and modeled.
High resolution models often exhibit a coastal-trapped 
Kelvin-like wave arriving from the equatorial zone
but even a coarse resolution model
can capture aspects of the
midlatitude wind-forced thermocline signals 
that propagate westward on ENSO time scales.
