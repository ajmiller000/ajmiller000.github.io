<b>Abstract.</b>


The South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) is an atmospheric system occurring in austral summer 
on the South America continent and sometimes extending over the adjacent South Atlantic. 
It is characterized by a persistent and very large, northwest-southeast-oriented, cloud band. 
Its presence over the ocean causes sea surface cooling that some past studies indicated as being 
produced by a decrease of incoming solar heat flux induced by the extensive cloud cover. 
Here we investigate ocean-atmosphere interaction processes in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SWA) 
during SACZ oceanic episodes, as well as the resulting modulations occurring in the 
oceanic mixed layer and their possible feedbacks on the marine atmospheric boundary layer. Our 
main interests and novel results are on verifying how the oceanic SACZ acts 
on dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms and contributes to the sea surface thermal 
balance in that region. In our oceanic SACZ episodes simulations we confirm an 
ocean surface cooling. Model results indicate that surface atmospheric circulation and the 
presence of an extensive cloud cover band over the SWA promote sea surface cooling via 
a combined effect of dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms, which are of the same order of magnitude. 
The sea surface temperature (SST) decreases in regions underneath oceanic SACZ positions, 
near Southeast Brazilian coast, in the South Brazil Bight (SBB) and offshore. 
This cooling is the result of a complex combination of factors caused by the decrease of solar 
shortwave radiation reaching the sea surface and the reduction of horizontal heat advection in 
the Brazil Current (BC) region. The weakened southward BC and adjacent offshore 
region heat advection seems to be associated with the surface atmospheric circulation caused by 
oceanic SACZ episodes, which rotate the surface wind and strengthen cyclonic oceanic mesoscale eddy. 
Another singular feature found in this study is the presence of an atmospheric cyclonic vortex Southwest 
of the SACZ (CVSS), both at the surface and aloft at 850 hPa near 24S and 45W. 
The CVSS induces an SST decrease southwestward from the SACZ position by inducing divergent 
Ekman transport and consequent offshore upwelling. This shows that the dynamical effects of 
atmospheric surface circulation associated with the oceanic SACZ are not restricted only 
to the region underneath the cloud band, but that they extend southwestward where 
the CVSS presence supports the oceanic SACZ convective activity and concomitantly 
modifies the ocean dynamics. Therefore, the changes produced in the oceanic 
dynamics by these SACZ events may be important to many areas of scientific and 
applied climate research. For example, episodes of oceanic SACZ may influence the pathways of 
pollutants as well as fish larvae dispersion in the region.
