<b>Abstract.</b>

The southern California Current Ecosystem (CCE) is a dynamic eastern boundary current ecosystem that is forced 
by ocean-atmosphere variability on interannual, multidecadal, and long-term secular time scales. Recent 
evidence suggests that apparent abrupt transitions in ecosystem conditions reflect linear tracking of the physical environment 
rather than oscillations between alternative preferred states. A space-for-time exchange 
is one approach that permits use of natural spatial variability in the CCE to 
develop a mechanistic understanding needed to project future temporal changes. The role of (sub)mesoscale frontal 
systems in altering rates of nutrient transport, primary and secondary production, export fluxes, and 
the rates of encounters between predators and prey is an issue central to this pelagic ecosystem and its 
future trajectory because the occurrence of such frontal features is increasing.
