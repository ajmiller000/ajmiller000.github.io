<b>Abstract.</b>

Past and future changes in the Aleutian Low are investigated by 
using observation-based  sea level pressure (SLP) 
datasets and CMIP5 multi-models. It is found that the 
Aleutian Low  intensity, measured by the North Pacific Index (NPI), has 
significantly strengthened during the  20th century, 
with the observed centennial-trend double the 
modeled counterpart for the multi-model 
average of historical simulations, suggesting compound signals 
of anthropogenic warming and natural variability. 
As climate warms under the strongest future warming scenario, 
the climatological-mean Aleutian Low will continue to 
intensify and expand northward, as manifested in the significant 
decrease (-1.3 hPa) of multi-model-averaged NPI 
which is 1.6 times its unforced internal variability and the 
central area of low-pressure (SLP < 999 hPa) 
expanded about 7 times that in the 20th century. A 
suite of idealized experiments further demonstrate that the deepening of 
the Aleutian Low can be driven by an El-Nino-like warming  of
the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST), with a reduction 
in the climatological-mean zonal SST gradient, which 
overshadows the dampening effect of a weakened wintertime  
land-ocean thermal contrast on the Aleutian Low change 
in a warmer climate. While the projected 
deepening of Aleutian Low on multi-model average 
is robust, individual model portrayals vary 
primarily in magnitude. Inter-model difference in 
surface warming amplitude over the Asian continent, which is 
found to explain about 31% of variance of the 
NPI changes across models, has a greater contribution than 
that in the spatial pattern of tropical Pacific 
SST warming (which explains about 23%) 
to model uncertainty in the projection of Aleutian Low intensity.
