<b>Abstract.</b>

Systematic improvements in algorithmic design of regional ocean circulation models have led to significant enhancement
in simulation ability across a wide range of space/time scales and marine system types. As an example, we briefly
review the Regional Ocean Modeling System, a member of a general class of three-dimensional, free-surface, terrain-following
numerical models. Noteworthy characteristics of the ROMS computational kernel include: consistent temporal
averaging of the barotropic mode to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers;
redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for local variations in the density field; vertical interpolation
performed using conservative parabolic splines; and higher-order, quasi-monotone advection algorithms. Examples of
quantitative skill assessment are shown for a tidally driven estuary, an ice-covered high-latitude sea, a wind- and buoyancy-forced
continental shelf, and a mid-latitude ocean basin. The combination of moderate-order spatial approximations,
enhanced conservation properties, and quasi-monotone advection produces both more robust and accurate, and less diffusive,
solutions than those produced in earlier terrain-following ocean models. Together with advanced methods of data
assimilation and novel observing system technologies, these capabilities constitute the necessary ingredients for multi-purpose
regional ocean prediction systems.
