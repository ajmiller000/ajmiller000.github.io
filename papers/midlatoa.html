<b>Abstract.</b>



Midlatitude ocean-atmosphere interactions are studied in simulations from a simplified coupled model that includes
     synoptic-scale atmospheric variability, ocean current advection of sea surface temperature (SST), and air-sea heat
     exchange. Although theoretical dynamical ("identical twin") predictions using this model have shown that the SST anomalies in
     this model indeed influence the atmosphere, we find here that standard cross-correlation and empirical orthogonal function
     analyses of monthly mean model output yield the standard result, familiar from observational studies, that the atmosphere
     forces the ocean with little or no feedback. Therefore, these analyses are inconclusive and leave open the question of whether
     anomalous SST is influencing the atmosphere. In contrast, we find that compositing strong warm events of model SST is a
     useful indicator of ocean forcing the atmosphere. We present additional evidence for oceanic influence on the atmosphere,
     namely, that ocean current advection appears to enhance the persistence of model SST anomalies through a feedback effect
     that is absent when only heat flux is allowed to influence SST anomaly evolution. Models with more complete physics must
     ultimately be used to conclusively demonstrate these results.
