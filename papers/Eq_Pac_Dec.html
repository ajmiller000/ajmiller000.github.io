<b>Abstract.</b>
The tropical Pacific exhibits decadal El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-like 
variability, characterized by meridionally broad sea surface temperature anomalies in the i
eastern Pacific. In this study, we focus on the variability in the equatorial Pacific band (5S-+5N), 
termed equatorial Pacific decadal variability (EPDV). While it is known that ocean 
dynamics plays an essential role in EPDV, the simulations by air-sea thermodynamically 
coupled slab ocean models (SOM) obscure the nature of the role of ocean dynamics. To 
 confront this issue, we use a mechanically decoupled simulation, which isolates the effects of 
 thermodynamic coupling processes and mean ocean circulation on EPDV. Thus, by comparing 
 the simulation to a SOM, we investigate the role of mean ocean circulation and show that it 
 plays a role in damping EPDV, primarily through mean equatorial Pacific upwelling. By 
 comparing the simulation to a fully coupled dynamic ocean model (DOM), we examine the 
 role of anomalous wind-driven ocean circulation and demonstrate that it plays a role in 
 amplifying EPDV. Further, this amplification strength overwhelms the upwelling damping 
 effect, resulting in the anomalous wind-driven ocean circulation forcing EPDV. The forcing 
 process, however, is distinct between the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, with the former 
 dominated by zonal advective feedback and Ekman pumping feedback, while the latter 
 controlled by thermocline feedback. Taking the EPDV as an example, our study advances the 
 understanding on the two distinct dynamical systems (SOM and DOM), benefiting the physical 
 interpretation of other climate variabilities.
