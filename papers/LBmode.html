<b>Abstract.</b>
Decadal variability in the North Pacific simulated by a coupled ocean atmosphere
 model is 
investigated. It is expressed most prominently in anomalies of  oceanic 
stream function in the upper  500m of the water column,  of sea surface temperature and
of latent heat flux in the Kuroshio-Oyashio 
extension (KOE) region  off Japan. 

The decadal signal off Japan is  initiated by winter-time Ekman pumping 
over the central North 
Pacific over the preceding  five years. The winter time forcing in the North Pacific is associated with
meridional shifts of the position and changes in the strength of the Aleutian Low, that
also force sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central North  Pacific
 and with opposite signs in
the Gulf of Alaska, off California and off Hawaii. The polarity of SST and Ekman
 pumping
is  such that warm central and cool eastern 
Pacific anomalies are associated with northward anomalies of  western boundary transports. 
In the 
KOE region anomalous western boundary currents lead to subsurface temperature anomalies
that are of the same sign as those in central Pacific. During 
winter time, deep mixed-layers bring this temperature signal to the surface 
where it is damped by air-sea heat exchange, primarily by latent, and secondarily by sensible heat fluxes.
This forcing of the atmosphere in the KOE region is associated with local 
changes of winter precipitation such that warm KOE SST anomalies coincide with an increase of
rain. 
Apart from this local, winter time feedback, the projection onto 
annual-averaged wind-stress in the central Pacific is, at best, 
 a weak positive feedback.

The dynamics underlying the decadal evolution of the oceanic stream function are
 consistent
with a linear, equivalent barotropic, forced Rossby wave. The decadal time scale
 
results from the integration of stochastic Ekman pumping along Rossby wave trajectories.
The Ekman pumping is  primarily due
to internal  atmospheric variability that has  significant expressions world-wide.
A positive feedback between coupled model KOE stream function
and North Pacific wind stress curl is consistent with the 
enhanced  variance of the coupled model  at a 20-30 year period. However, the time series
are too short to confidently distinguish this positive feedback hypothesis
from sampling variability or from forcing that originates outside of the mid-latitude North Pacific.

Comparisons with available observations confirm the seasonality of 
the forcing, the like signs of  SST anomalies 
in the central North Pacific and in the  KOE region, the up to five year lag between
these SST anomalies, and the associated 
damping in the KOE region  by the latent heat. In accordance with the coupled model results,
observed SST anomalies in the KOE region can be predicted
from the history of the wind stress curl over the North Pacific.
