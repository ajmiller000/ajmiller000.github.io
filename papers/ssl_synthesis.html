<b>Abstract.</b>

Declines of Steller sea lion (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>)
populations in the Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska could 
be a consequence of physical oceanographic changes associated with the 
1976-77 climate regime shift.  Changes in ocean climate are hypothesized 
to have affected the quantity, quality and accessibility 
of prey, which in turn may have affected the rates 
of birth and death of sea lions.  Recent studies 
of the spatial and temporal variations in the ocean climate system 
of the North Pacific support this hypothesis.  Ocean climate changes 
appear to have created adaptive opportunities for various species that are 
preyed upon by Steller sea lions at mid-trophic levels. The 
east-west asymmetry of the oceanic response to 
climate forcing after 1976-77 is consistent with 
both the temporal aspect (populations decreased after the late 
1970's) and the spatial aspect of the decline (western, but 
not eastern, sea lion populations decreased). These broad-scale 
climate variations appear to be modulated by regionally sensitive 
biogeographic structures along the Aleutian Islands and Gulf 
of Alaska, which include a transition point from coastal 
to open-ocean conditions at Samalga Pass westward along the Aleutian 
Islands.  These transition points delineate distinct clusterings of different 
combinations of prey species, which are 
in turn correlated with differential population sizes 
and trajectories of Steller sea lions. Archaeological records 
spanning 4000 years further indicate that sea lion 
populations have experienced major shifts in abundance in the past.  
Shifts in ocean climate are the most 
parsimonious underlying explanation for the broad 
suite of ecosystem changes that have been observed 
in the North Pacific Ocean in recent decades.
