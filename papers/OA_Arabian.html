<b>Abstract.</b>
Observations of the western Arabian Sea over the last decade have revealed 
a rich filamentary eddy structure, with large horizontal 
SST gradients in the ocean, developing in response to the southwest 
monsoon winds. This summertime oceanic condition triggers an intense mesoscale coupled interaction, 
whose overall influence on the longer-term properties 
of this ocean remains uncertain. In this study, a high-resolution 
regional coupled model is employed to explore this feedback effect on 
the long-term dynamical and thermodynamical structure of the ocean.
<br>
The observed relationship between the near-surface winds and mesoscale SSTs 
generate Ekman pumping velocities at the scale of the cold filaments, whose magnitude 
is the order of 1 m/day in both the model and observations. This additional Ekman-driven velocity, 
induced by the wind-eddy interaction, accounts for approximately 10-20% of oceanic 
vertical velocity of the cold filaments. This implies that Ekman pumping arising 
from the mesoscale coupled feedback makes a nontrivial contribution to the vertical structure 
of the upper ocean and the evolution of mesoscale eddies, with obvious implications for 
marine ecosystem and biogeochemical variability.
<br>
Furthermore, SST features associated with cold filaments substantially reduce the latent heat 
loss. The long-term latent heat flux change due to eddies in the model is 
approximately 10-15 W/m2 over the cold filaments, which is consistent with 
previous estimates based on short-term in situ measurements. Given the shallow 
mixed layer, this additional surface heat flux warms the cold filament at the 
rate of 0.3-0.4C/month over a season with strong eddy activity, and 0.1-0.2C/month over 
the 12-year mean, rendering overall low-frequency modulation of SST feasible. 
This long-term mixed layer heating by the surface flux is approximately +-10% 
of the lateral heat flux by the eddies, yet it can be comparable to 
the vertical heat flux. Potential dynamic and thermodynamic impacts of this observed 
air-sea interaction on the monsoons and regional climate are yet to 
be quantified given the strong correlation between the Somalia upwelling SST and the Indian summer monsoons.
