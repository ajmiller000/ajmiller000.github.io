<b>Abstract.</b>

A simplified coupled atmosphere-ocean model is used to explore the influence of evolving midlatitude sea surface
     temperature (SST) anomalies on the theoretical extended-range predictability of the atmospheric wintertime circulation in
     the Northern Hemisphere. After approximately two weeks, SST anomalies begin to significantly influence the overlying
     atmospheric flow, compared to flow over the climatological SST field. If the evolving sea surface temperature field is
     specified from model "observed" flows, then predictions of atmospheric time-averaged flow, for one month and longer
     averages, are significantly enhanced over predictions based on the atmospheric model with climatological SST. Predictions
     using the coupled model, however, are not significantly different from predictions using the atmospheric model with
     persistent SST anomalies, because SST anomalies are forced increasingly erroneously by atmospheric variables that
     rapidly lose their predictability.
