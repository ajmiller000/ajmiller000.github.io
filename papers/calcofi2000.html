<b>Abstract.</b>
Surveys of temperature, salinity, and velocity from
CalCOFI, altimetric measurements of sea level and drifter observations
of temperature and velocity during the 1997-98 El Nino are now being fit
with an eddy-resolving ocean model of the Southern California Bight
region to obtain dynamically consistent estimates of eddy variability.
Skill evaluations are quantified by the
model-data mismatch (rms error) during the fitting interval and eventually
by forecasting independent data.
Preliminary results of fitting July 1997 physical fields
are discussed.
The physical fields are used to drive a three-dimensional NPZD-type 
model to be
fit to sub-surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), nitrate and bulk zooplankton 
from CalCOFI surveys and surface
Chl-a from SeaWiFS.  
Preliminary results of testing the ecosystem model
in one-dimensional and three-dimensional form are discussed.
