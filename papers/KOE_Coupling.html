<b>Abstract.</b>
Relative wind (RW; wind relative to surface currents) has been shown to play a crucial role in air-sea
interactions, influencing both atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. While the RW effects through momentum
flux are well-documented, those through turbulent heat fluxes remain unknown. In this study, we investigate
two distinct surface current feedbacks – those associated with the momentum flux and turbulent heat fluxes
– by modifying respective bulk formulations in the regional ocean-atmosphere coupled system, and analyze
both immediate and seasonal changes in the boundary layers. Our results show that strong ocean currents in
the Kuroshio Current and Extension significantly impact surface coupling, with responses generally contingent
on the wind-current angle: an increase (decrease) in air-sea momentum and turbulent heat fluxes occurs when
the low-level wind and surface currents are aligned (opposed). The instantaneous responses to surface currents
include changes in low-level wind, surface current speed, and humidity, which are consistent with anticipated
changes for a given wind-current angle based on the bulk formulations. While the wind-current angle is still
an important factor, it does not adequately capture the seasonal responses. On the seasonal timescale, both
surface current feedbacks can alter the path of the Kuroshio Extension and mesoscale activities, resulting in
different background states that affect air-sea momentum and turbulent heat exchanges. Our results suggest
that the energetic current system, such as the Kuroshio Current and Extension, can be significantly influenced
by surface current coupling through both momentum and turbulent heat fluxes.
