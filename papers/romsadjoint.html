<b>Abstract.</b>
The Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) is a new generation ocean
general circulation model that is rapidly gaining favour 
in the ocean modelling community. The tangent linear and
adjoint versions of ROMS have recently been developed,
and a new suite of tools that utilize these models for
a variety of applications are now available to the ocean
modelling community. In this paper we will describe the
tangent linear and adjoint components of ROMS, and
present examples from the tools that are currently
available to ROMS users. In particular we will consider
the finite time eigenmodes and
the adjoint finite time eigenmodes of the tangent linear propagator,
the singular vectors of the propagator, and its
forcing singular vectors and stochastic optimals.
The pseudospectra of the tangent linear resolvent
matrix are also considered.
Examples of each type of calculation will be presented
for a time evolving double gyre ocean circulation in a rectangular
ocean basin.
