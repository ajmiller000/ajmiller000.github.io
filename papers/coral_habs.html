<b>Abstract.</b>
The oceanographic environment is a key element in structuring coral reef ecosystems by
setting the range of physical and chemical conditions in which coral reef-builders live. A
cluster analysis of physical and chemical oceanographic data is used to classify coral
habitats in the remote tropical and subtropical Pacific ocean based on average
temperature, temperature seasonal cycle, nutrient levels, salinity, aragonite saturation
state, storm frequency, intense hurricane hits, and dissolved oxygen as well as
temperature anomalies in degree heating weeks. The resulting seven geographic habitats
are stable to perturbations in types of data used in the cluster analysis. Based on recent
coral reef survey data in the area, coral cover was related to the identified geographic
regions. The habitats tend to be geographically clustered, and each is characterized by a
unique combination of oceanographic conditions. Previous studies suggest coral reef
habitats are associated with a uniform array of oceanographic conditions, while our
results demonstrate that finer-scale variations in physical variables may control coral reef
environments. The results better define the physical environment of remote coral reefs,
forming a foundation for future work addressing physical habitat perturbation and
anthropogenic impacts on reefs.
