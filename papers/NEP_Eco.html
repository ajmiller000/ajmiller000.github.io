<b>Abstract.</b>

A basin-wide interdecadal change in both the physical state and the ecology 
of the North Pacific occurred near the end of 1976. 
Here we use a physical-ecosystem model to examine whether changes in the physical 
environment associated with the 1976-1977 transition influenced the lower 
trophic levels of the food web and if so by what means. 
The physical component is an ocean general circulation model, while 
the biological component contains 10 compartments: two phytoplankton, two zooplankton, 
two detritus pools, nitrate, ammonium, silicate, and carbon dioxide. 
The model is forced with observed atmospheric fields during 1960-1999. 
During spring, there is a ~40% reduction in plankton biomass in all four plankton 
groups during 1977-1988 relative to 1970-1976 in the central Gulf of Alaska (GOA). 
The epoch difference in plankton appears to be controlled by the mixed layer 
depth. Enhanced Ekman pumping after 1976 caused the halocline to shoal, and 
thus the mixed layer depth, which extends to the top of the 
halocline in late winter, did not penetrate as deep in the central GOA. As a 
result, more phytoplankton remained in the euphotic zone, and phytoplankton 
biomass began to increase earlier in the year after the 1976 transition. 
Zooplankton biomass also increased, but then grazing pressure led to a 
strong decrease in phytoplankton by April followed by a drop in zooplankton 
by May: Essentially, the mean seasonal cycle of plankton biomass 
was shifted earlier in the year. As the seasonal 
cycle progressed, the difference in plankton concentrations between 
epochs reversed sign again, leading to slightly 
greater zooplankton biomass during summer in the later epoch.
