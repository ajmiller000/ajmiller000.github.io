<b>Abstract.</b>
State-space models were used to derive nonparametric sea 
surface temperature (SST) trends from 26 locations in 
and around the Gulf of Alaska for the period 1950-97. 
The SST trends reflect important large-scale climate impacts 
associated with El Nino events and regime shifts. 
But they also reveal significant spatial heterogeneity across 
the region. The SST trends cluster into five distinct regions 
that define a robust zonal and meridional asymmetry. The 
meridional differences reflect the relative impact of El 
Nino events, while the zonal differences reflect variations 
in the timing and amplitude of a region-wide post-1970 
warming trend. The 1976 regime shift is evident primarily as an 
accelerated warming in the northern and eastern portions of 
the Gulf of Alaska. The climate signals identified in 
the SST series are of sufficient magnitude and duration to 
potentially foster changes in lower trophic productivity and structure, 
which could lead to a broader ecosystem 
reorganization. Regional differences in Steller 
sea lion population trends may have resulted from 
a spatially heterogeneous upper-ocean response to large-scale climate variability.
