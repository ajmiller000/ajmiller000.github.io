<b>Abstract.</b>
Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a key role in California's water supply and are 
responsible for most of the extreme precipitation and major 
ooding along the west coast of
North America. Given the high societal impact, it is critical to improve our understanding
and prediction of ARs. This study uses a regional coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling
system to make hindcasts of ARs up to 14 days. The roles of air{sea interactions
in AR events are investigated by comparing coupled model hindcasts to hindcasts made
using persistent sea surface temperature (SST). Two groups of coupled runs are 
highlighted in the comparison: (1) ARs occurring during times with strong SST cooling and
(2) ARs occurring during times with weak SST cooling. During the events with strong
SST cooling, the coupled model simulates strong upward air-sea heat 
fluxes associated
with ARs; on the other hand, when the SST cooling is weak, the coupled model 
simulates downward air-sea heat 
fluxes in the AR region. Validation data shows that the 
coupled model skillfully reproduces the evolving SST, as well as the surface turbulent heat
transfers between the ocean and atmosphere. To evaluate the 
influence of the ocean on
ARs we analyze two representative variables of AR intensity, the vertically integrated
water vapor (IWV) and integrated vapor transport (IVT). During strong SST cooling
AR events the simulated IWV is improved by about 12% in the coupled run at lead times
greater than one week. For IVT, which is about twice more variable, the improvement
in the coupled run is about 5%.
