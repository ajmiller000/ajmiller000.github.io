<b>Abstract.</b>
This study uses a century length pre-industrial climate simulation by the Community 
Earth System Model (CESM 1.0) to explore statistical relationships between dust, clouds and 
atmospheric circulation, and to suggest a semi-direct dynamical, rather than microphysical, 
mechanism linking subtropical North Atlantic lower tropospheric cloud cover with North 
African dust transport. The length of the run allows us to account for interannual variability of
dust emissions and transport downstream of North Africa in the model. CESM.s mean 
climatology and probability distribution of aerosol optical depth in this region agrees well with 
available AERONET observations. In addition, CESM shows strong seasonal cycles of dust 
burden and lower tropospheric cloud fraction, with maximum values occurring during boreal 
summer, when a strong correlation between these two variables exists downstream of North 
Africa over the subtropical North Atlantic. Calculations of Estimated Inversion Strength (EIS) 
and composites of EIS on high and low downstream North Africa dust months during boreal 
summer reveal that dust is likely increasing inversion strength over this region due to both solar 
absorption and reflection. We find no evidence for a microphysical link between dust and lower 
tropospheric clouds in this region. These results yield new insight over an extensive period of 
time into the complex relationship between North African dust and lower tropospheric clouds 
over the open ocean, which has previously been hindered by spatiotemporal constraints of 
observations. Our findings lay a framework for future analyses using different climate models 
and sub-monthly data over regions with different underlying dynamics.
