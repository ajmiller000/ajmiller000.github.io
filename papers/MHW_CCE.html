<b>Abstract.</b> In the past decades, the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) has experienced intense marine heatwaves (MHWs), 
  which have induced significant disruptions to local phytoplankton communities. Using 30-year CalCOFI observations, 
  we identify a previously undocumented vertical structure in chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) response to MHWs, 
  characterized by CHL reductions in the surface layer coupled with increases in the subsurface. By integrating 
  observations and coupled physical-biogeochemical model products, we demonstrate that surface CHL declines are 
  primarily attributed to suppressed nutrient upwelled to the upper ocean. Although surface irradiance increased 
  modestly (+3.5%), light availability in the subsurface layer improved substantially (+21.7%) due to reduced 
  phytoplankton shading at the surface. Concurrent with enhanced lateral nutrient transport, phytoplankton growth 
  at depth was promoted during MHWs. This study highlights the pivotal role of 
  subsurface phytoplankton dynamics in shaping the vertical CHL structure and its variability under extreme events.
