<b>Abstract.</b> In the past decades, the California Current Ecosystem has experienced 
  intense marine heatwaves, which have induced significant disruptions to local phytoplankton communities. 
  Here, using 30-year cruise observations, we identify a previously undocumented vertical structure 
  in chlorophyll-a concentration response to marine heatwaves, characterized by reductions in the 
  surface layer coupled with increases in the subsurface. By integrating observations and coupled 
  physical-biogeochemical model products, we demonstrate that declines of surface chlorophyll-a are 
  primarily attributed to suppressed nutrient upwelled to the upper ocean. Although surface irradiance 
  increased modestly (+3.5%), light availability in the subsurface layer improved substantially (+21.7%) 
  due to reduced phytoplankton shading at the surface. Concurrent with enhanced lateral nutrient 
  transport, phytoplankton growth at depth was promoted during heatwave events. This study highlights 
  the pivotal role of subsurface phytoplankton dynamics in shaping the vertical chlorophyll-a 
  concentration structure and its variability under extreme events.
