<b>Abstract.</b>
Coastal areas are by far the most complex and dynamic of all ocean 
regions. They are important zones for the accumulation and transformation 
of nutrients and sediments derived from terrestrial and atmospheric sources. 
These areas are also crucial fish nursery and foraging grounds 
and are home to the majority of ocean fish stocks that compose our 
fisheries Approximately 90% of the total marine fish catch is derived 
from continental shelf regions, an area comprising less than 8% 
of the total ocean area. The proximity of the coastal ocean to 
terrestrial and fluvial influences complicates the underlying coastal 
ocean dynamics often associated with coastal regions, 
such as tides, coastal trapped waves, shoaling internal 
waves, upwelling, etc.  Mankind has heavily influenced coastal 
regions by modifying freshwater influx patterns, altering nutrient 
and sediment fluxes from both fluvial and atmospheric sources, and 
overexploiting fisheries resources. One goal in understanding the dynamics 
of coastal regions is to use this knowledge to improve coastal 
management practices so as to reduce the impact of anthropogenic 
influences. However, gaining an understanding of the mechanisms 
important to answering a host of questions related to 
coastal ocean regions requires the coordinated use of 
a wide variety of data sets, of both satellite and 
in situ origin, and numerical models.
