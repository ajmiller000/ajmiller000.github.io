<b>Abstract.</b>
Recent work has suggested that North African dust variability over the tropical 
and subtropical North Atlantic can account for a large fraction of decadal 
changes in SST anomalies. The response of monthly SST anomalies to dust outbreaks on 
interannual and decadal timescales is characterized by comparing two Community Earth System Model 
(CESM) simulations with and without interannual variability of dust. 
These comparisons show an increase in SST variance in the interactive (interannual dust variability allowed) 
run over the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic, suggesting that fluctuations of North African 
dust can drive regional changes in SST variability. The leading mode of 
coupled SST/wind variability in the tropical Atlantic (the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM)) 
is examined. Although the observed SST spatial pattern associated with the AMM appears as 
an out-of-phase cross-hemispheric dipole pattern, latent heat 
flux coupling to the surface horizontal wind only occurs in the Northern 
Hemisphere. In addition, strong cross-equatorial wind flow normally associated 
with an interhemispheric SST gradient is present in the CESM 
interactive simulation, but absent in the prescribed simulation. These results 
indicate that modeled interannual dust variations influence deep tropical WES dynamics. 
Strong positive anomalies of summertime dust burden over 
the subtropical North Atlantic are associated with strong negative 
values of the coupled SST MCA principal components, indicating that 
interannual variability of North African dust changes the spatial loading of summertime SST associated with the AMM.
