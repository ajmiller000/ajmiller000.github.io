<b>Abstract.</b> Disturbance ecology is underdeveloped 
  in marine pelagic ecosystems relative to terrestrial and aquatic benthic habitats, in part because, 
  when measured relative to a fixed location, postdisturbance recovery involves the advection of entire 
  communities in addition to biotic interactions. A Lagrangian frame-of-reference perspective alleviates 
  this issue. Using results from the California Current Ecosystem, we highlight three approaches: 
  in situ Lagrangian, synthetic Lagrangian, and simulated Lagrangian studies. Within a Lagrangian context, 
  extratropical marine heatwaves and El Niños represent press disturbances or alterations to the 
  disturbance regime. Individual up- welling events are more appropriately viewed as pulse disturbances. 
  Upwelling disturbances stimulate rapid growth of pioneer species (diatoms), with herbivores (copepods) 
  lagging these blooms by approximately 3 weeks. The climax community is an assemblage of small low-nutrient 
  specialists with high Shannon diversity. We suggest that pelagic ecosystems can be ideal systems for 
  investigating disturbance recovery because of the rapid response 
  times of marine primary producers and herbivores.
