<b>Abstract.</b>
The Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) is the dominant 
mode of tropical SST/wind coupled variability. Modeling studies have 
implicated wind-evaporation-SST (WES) feedback as the primary 
driver of the AMM.s evolution across the Atlantic basin; however, a 
robust coupling of the SST and winds has not been shown observationally. This study examines 
observed AMM growth, propagation, and decay as a 
result of WES interactions. Investigation of a lagged 
maximum covariance analysis shows that boreal wintertime atmospheric forcing generates positive 
SST anomalies (SSTA) through a reduction surface evaporative cooling. 
When the AMM peaks in magnitude during spring and summer, upward 
latent heat flux anomalies occur over the warmest SSTs and act to 
dampen the initial forcing. In contrast, on the southwestward edge 
of the SSTA, SST-forced cross-equatorial flow reduces 
the strength of the climatological trade winds and provides an anomalous latent heat flux into 
the ocean, which causes southwestward propagation of the initial atmosphere-forced SSTA through WES 
dynamics. Additionally, the lead-lag relationship of the ocean 
and atmosphere indicates a transition from an atmosphere-forcing-ocean 
regime in the northern subtropics to a highly coupled regime in 
the northern tropics that is not observed in the southern hemisphere. CMIP5 models 
poorly simulate the latitudinal transition from a one-way interaction 
to a two-way feedback, which may explain why 
they struggle to reproduce observed coupled interactions between tropical Atlantic SST and 
winds. This analysis provides valuable insight 
on how meridional modes act as links between extratropical and tropical 
variability and focuses future research aimed at improving climate model simulations.
