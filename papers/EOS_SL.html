<b>Abstract.</b>
Rising sea level poses significant challenges
to infrastructure and populations,
particularly for coastal [Heberger et al.,
2009] and island communities [Webb and
Kench, 2010] in the North Pacific where population
density at or near coastal waters
is high. A significant portion of the United
States. security, commerce, and ecosystem
assets are located at or near the coast,
making them vulnerable to sea level rise.
Although global mean sea level (MSL) rise
is a fundamental consideration, regional
mean sea level (RSL) height variability
within ocean basins and along their boundaries
can be more critical, particularly in the
North Pacific where the amplitude of interannual
variability is high.
